Chef Cookbooks
==============

A set of cookbooks to use Chef for managing Django and Rails servers.  These
cookbooks are under heavy development, so things will be changing a lot over
the next several weeks.  When they get closer to stability, I'll start adding
comments and documentation so that others can use them also.

Many of these cookbooks came from the [Opscode repository][1], but they have
all been heavily modified.  Some of the ideas came from Eric Holscher's great
[blog posts][2] about using Chef with Django.
